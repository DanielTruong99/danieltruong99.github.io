At Bosch, I had the opportunity to work as an Embedded Software Engineer intern, where I supported projects related to AUTOSAR. During this time, I gained hands-on experience with the development and testing procedures of automotive embedded systems.

The most exciting part for me was Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing, where ECU control signals are connected to a real-time computer simulating the behavior of a vehicle. This gave me valuable insight into bridging software with real-world hardware.
