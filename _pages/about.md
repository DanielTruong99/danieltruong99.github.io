<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
My name is [Truong Dat Thanh]() and I am a final year MSc student at Sungkyunkwan University,
Department of Intelligent Robotics, advised by Prof. [Choi Hyouk Ryeol](https://mecha.skku.ac.kr/roboticsinnovatory/index.do).
I earned my bachelorâ€™s degree in in Mechatronics Engineering from [HCMUTE](https://en.hcmute.edu.vn/) in 2022, where I worked with Dr. [Truong Quang Tri](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lji2NnEAAAAJ&hl=en), Dr. [Pham Tan Hanh](https://hanhpt23.github.io/index.html) and Prof. [Nguyen Truong Thinh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kh9KljsAAAAJ&hl=vi).

<h2 class="section-title">Research Interests</h2>

My current research focuses on [RL-driven control for humanoid robot](); [Diffusion & generative models for motion planning]();
[Convex optimization, optimal and robust control](); [Dynamical systems, real time embedded system](); [Physical AI]().

I am eager to explore robotics from both theoretical and practical perspectives, leveraging my foundation in dynamical system, control theory, optimization, machine learning and embedded system.
